### What is PGInference?

`PGInference` is an `R` package for performing Powerful Graph fused lasso Inference.

### How do I install the package?

To download the PGInference package, use the code below.
``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yiqunchen/PGInference")
library(PGInference)
```

### Why do we need PGInference?
Double-dipping &mdash; or more formally, generating a hypothesis based on your data, and then testing the hypothesis on that same data &mdash; renders classical hypothesis tests (e.g., z-test or Wilcoxon-rank for a difference-in-means; and in general any standard hypothesis tests) invalid, in the sense that Type I error is not controlled.
